### Question: 1
<p>

	Write a C++ program to reverse a stack using recursion, without using any loop.
<br>

	Input: elements present in stack from top to bottom 28 29 30 31
<br>

	Output: 31 30 29 28 
</p>

### Question: 2
<P>

	Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element.

Example:

	Input: arr[] = [ 4, 5 , 2 , 25 ]

Output: 

	4 –> 5
	5 –> 25
	2 –> 25  
	25 -> -1

### Question: 3
<p>

	Given an array and a positive integer k, find the first negative integer for each window (contiguous subarray) of size k. If a window does not contain a negative integer, then print 0 for that window.

Example: 

	Input: arr[] = {-8, 2, 3, -6, 10}, k = 2

	Output: -8 0 -6 -6

First negative integer for each window of size k

	{-8, 2} = -8

	{2, 3} = 0 (does not contain a negative integer)

	{3, -6} = -6

	{-6, 10} = -6

### Question: 4
<p>

	Given a queue of integers of even length, rearrange the elements by interleaving the first half of the queue with the second half of the queue.
Example:

	Input:  1 2 3 4

Output:

	1 3 2 4
